we_universal is a modern, clean style for **phpBB 3.3.x**.
It uses principles of flat design and Responsive Web Design technique.
It fits great on desktops and various mobile devices. This style is suitable for
all kinds of forum communities and it is compatible with all major browsers.

we_universal is built on top of prosilver and uses [template + asset
inheritance](https://www.phpbb.com/styles/create/#a-inheritance). Custom CSS
classes are prefixed with `inventea-` namespace. The .css is split into separate files corresponding
to the prosilver structure.
